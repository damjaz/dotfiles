I can't feel the love
Ooh Baby
There's no other you
If I ain't got you I'm nothing
'Cause there's no deeper love
Than what we're feeling
There's no deeper love
Ooh Baby
'Cause there's no deeper love
Than what we're feeling
There's no deeper love

There's no deeper love

I can't be without you
I'm in way to deep and I'm drowning in devotion of love
Can't find a new emotion
That's ever in love and I can't deny it's real
'Cause there's no deeper love
Ooh Baby
'Cause there's no deeper love
than what we're feeling
there's no deeper love

'Cause there's no deeper love

'Cause there's no deeper love
