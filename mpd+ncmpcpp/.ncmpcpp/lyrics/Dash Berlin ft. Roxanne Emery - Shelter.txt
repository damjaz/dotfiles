(feat. Roxanne Emery)

You are the sun in my sky
Even when the stars all die
You are gonna make me shine
You make me shine cos

I’m born forever your guide
For all of my life
I will be by your side

And I’ll be there when you fall, yeah
And they’ll be no pain at all

And I’ll be your shelter
Your shelter from the storm
Yeah always be your shelter
I’ll be there if you fall
And if you walk a lonely road
Know that you’re not alone
Cos I’ll be your shelter
Your shelter from this storm

So when rain’s coming down
Feel you can’t stand your ground
I won’t let you drown
 
And I’ll be there when you fall, yeah
And they’ll be no pain at all

And I’ll be your shelter
Your shelter from this storm
Yeah always be your shelter
I’ll be there if you fall
And if you walk a lonely road
Know that you’re not alone, yeah
Cos I’ll be your shelter
Your shelter from this storm (storm)
Your shelter from the…(storm)
Your shelter from the storm
